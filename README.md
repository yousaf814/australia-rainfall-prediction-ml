# Australia Rainfall Prediction using Machine Learning 🌧️

This is a machine learning project designed to predict rainfall in Australia using historical weather data. The model is built using Python, pandas, and scikit-learn, and it showcases feature selection, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Predict whether it will rain tomorrow using weather data such as humidity, temperature, pressure, and rainfall records, etc.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the CSV dataset file (you can link to a dataset source or upload it here)
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebook showing step-by-step ML pipeline
- `src/`: (Optional) Python scripts for model training and preprocessing
- `requirements.txt`: Python package dependencies

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach

- **Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding, scaling
- **Model**: Logistic Regression
- **Evaluation**: Accuracy

## 📦 Dependencies
